# Intelligent Software Test Automation Using AI and Keyword-Driven Testing

## Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered test automation framework using Llama 3 to
generate and improve keyword-driven test cases for Robot Framework. The setup will allow
continued customization and training by SDT personnel, enhancing test efficiency,
coverage, and defect detection.

## Project Goals

The objectives of the AI-powered test automation framework are:

1. AI-Powered Test Automation Framework
    - Develop an AI-powered test automation framework using Llama 3 for generating
and improving keyword-driven test cases.
2. Customization of Pre-trained LLM
    - Customize a pre-trained LLM to adapt to specific tasks using SDT's data and
intellectual property.
3. Setup for Continuous Training
    - Create a setup enabling SDT personnel to train and update the LLM with new
data continually.
4. Enhanced Defect Detection and Test Coverage
    - Enhance defect detection, test coverage, and software quality through intelligent
test case generation.
5. Integration of Knowledge Graph
    - Integrate the knowledge graph encapsulating domain knowledge, key software
testing concepts, and SDT's specific keyword definitions.
6. Guidance and Python Scripts
    - Provide a detailed guide and Python scripts for training and using the customized
LLM.
7. Web-Based Solution for Accessibility
    - Propose and set up an inexpensive, web-based solution for accessing Llama 3
remotely, ensuring ease of use and accessibility
