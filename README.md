## Intelligent Software Test Automation Using AI and Keyword-Driven Testing

### Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered test automation framework using Llama 3 to
generate and improve keyword-driven test cases for Robot Framework. The setup will allow
continued customization and training by SDT personnel, enhancing test efficiency,
coverage, and defect detection.


### Project Goals

The objectives of the AI-powered test automation framework are:

1. AI-Powered Test Automation Framework
- Develop an AI-powered test automation framework using Llama 3 for generating
and improving keyword-driven test cases.
2. Customization of Pre-trained LLM
- Customize a pre-trained LLM to adapt to specific tasks using SDT's data and
intellectual property.
3. Setup for Continuous Training
a. Create a setup enabling SDT personnel to train and update the LLM with new
data continually.
4. Enhanced Defect Detection and Test Coverage
a. Enhance defect detection, test coverage, and software quality through intelligent
test case generation.
5. Integration of Knowledge Graph
a. Integrate the knowledge graph encapsulating domain knowledge, key software
testing concepts, and SDT's specific keyword definitions.
6. Guidance and Python Scripts
a. Provide a detailed guide and Python scripts for training and using the customized
LLM.
7. Web-Based Solution for Accessibility
a. Propose and set up an inexpensive, web-based solution for accessing Llama 3
remotely, ensuring ease of use and accessibility
